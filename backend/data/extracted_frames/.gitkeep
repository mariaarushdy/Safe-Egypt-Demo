# Place a .gitkeep file in this directory to ensure the "extracted_frames" and "uploads" folders 
# (and any folders inside them) are tracked by git, but all files inside these directories are ignored.
# 
# To accomplish this, add the following rules to your .gitignore (if not already present):
#
# backend/data/extracted_frames/*
# !backend/data/extracted_frames/.gitkeep
# backend/data/uploads/*
# !backend/data/uploads/.gitkeep
#
# This will keep the folder structure but ignore all files within.
